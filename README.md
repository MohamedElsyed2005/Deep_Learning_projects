# Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of my deep learning projects and experiments, implemented using **TensorFlow/Keras**, **scikit-learn**, and other ML libraries.

## Projects

- **Preceptron/**  
  Implementations of **Perceptron** and **Multilayer Perceptron (MLPs)** models.  
  Includes:
  - Perceptron on Iris dataset
  - MLPs using scikit-learn
  - MLPs using Keras (TensorFlow)
  - Model visualization (Fashion-MNIST)

*(More projects will be added as I continue learning and experimenting.)*

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow, scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, pandas
